##Instructions for testing

1. Make sure you have installed all the required tools by running  
   >'pip install requirements.txt'
2. create the database(s). 'blogly' if you're using the app, if not, just  
   'blogly_test' for the test file  
   - If you are using the app, you can seed the database by running seed.py
3. use python module with test_app.py  
   >'python -m unittest test_app.py'

There is **no validation**. You can easily crash this, so be careful

Sorry it doesn't look good. I don't *really* care. It's an exercise.
